# DiscordMusicBot
This was a fun Project.. Maybe I am going to resume developing it at some point in time, but not now. 
Why did I create a Music Bot? - Because I hate the restrictions of Rythm Bot

Theoretically the Bot is already functional, it is just missing a few features, which I would have loved to implement. Also it is a little bit unstable.
